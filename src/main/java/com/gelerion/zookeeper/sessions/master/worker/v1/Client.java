/**
 * Created by denis.shuvalov on 10/04/2018.
 *
 * The final component of the system is the Client application that queues new tats to be executed on a worker
 *
 * We will be adding znodes under /tasks that represents commands to be carries out on the worker
 * We weill be using sequential znodes, which gives us two benefits:
 *  - the sequence number will indicate the order in which the tasks were queued.
 *  - the sequence number will create unique paths for tasks with minimal work
